## SketchGPT: Animate static 2D sketch illustrations using text-to-video prior

Animation of hand-drawn sketches using traditional tools is challenging and complex. Sketches provide a visual representation for an explanation, and the animation of these sketches provides an experience of real-time scenarios. In this paper we propose SketchGPT, an approach to animate a given input sketch using a text prompt description. We use parametric representation of the strokes of sketch. Since previous methods are not able to estimate the smooth and accurate motion, they also fail to preserve the topology of the sketch in the animation. We use a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion model with SDS loss that guides the motion of the sketch stroke. Further, we propose length-area (LA) regularization to maintain temporal consistency by estimating smooth and accurate motion. Further, a shape preserving As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP) loss to maintain the rigidity of the sketch helps to avoid the topology change and shape distortion. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art results in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.
